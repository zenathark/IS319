####Scoring:
  * 60% Exams
  * 25% Homework
  * 15% Final proyect

#####Final Proyect: To create a wav or mp3 player using basic API calls
  - Multimedia libraries cannot be used
  - A file digester for the selected file format must be implemented
  - If mp3 is selected, an algorithm for decompression must be implemented
  - The need for a GUI interface will be decided later on
  - The file must be start almost instantly
  - It has to use RAM memory efficiently

####How we came up with the idea of a *computer*?
- In order to understand what an Operating System is, we must understand the idea behind computer hardware
- Computers and other related deviced scuh mobile phones are based on a mathematical construct
- Alan Turing defined this hypotethical device in 1936 known as the Turing Machine

####A representation of a turing machine

---
####How a turing machine operates?
+ The head advances one place
+ The symbol is read
+ The state machine changes its state according to the symbol read
---
####How a microprocessor *mimics* a TM?
+ The tape is usually the Random Access Memory **RAM** because of its fast read/write speed
+ The head is a special element of the processor called Program Counter **PC**
+ The state machine are the rest of the processor elements such as registers, **ALU**, **Control Logic**, etc.
